          <h1 class="text-danger mt-5">What is Total Patient Care?</h1>

          <p id="definition">Definition : Total patient care is a model of care designed around a registered nurse
            overseeing personal care to one patient during a specific period of time.</p>

          <p class="text-center">“<span class="text-primary">Total patient care</span> and primary nursing are
            patient-oriented and rely on registered nurses (RNs) to deliver care.”</p>


          <p>This model of care can take place in-home or in a hospital setting. The delivery of care varies for total care
            models depending on the setting it’s being provided in (i.e., a group of nurses may rotate between patients to
            provide care around the clock instead of one, dedicated nurse). As discussed in our comparison of medication
            management vs medication reminders, caregivers have two proficiency levels: certified nurse assistants (CNA) and
            registered nurses. RNs can assist with medical, home care, and care management needs, such as oversight of
            health services. CNAs provide personal care and companionship services, such as transportation.Together, RNs and
            in-home CNA caregivers work to provide total patient services to clients in the comfort of their homes. </p>

          <h1 class="text-danger mt-5">The Benefits of Total Patient Care Nursing</h1>
          <p>In general, the greatest benefit of total patient care is the one-on-one attention and monitoring a skilled
            nursing professional provides. The drawback to total patient care is the price. A dedicated nurse providing
            medical assistance is more expensive than a professional caregiver who is hired for companionship services.
            Unlike hospice care, total care is not provided indefinitely, but rather assists a patient for a short period of
            time or longer if needed. Total patient care relies on a good, patient-nurse dynamic. When it comes to senior
            care, a compassionate, relational caregiver is essential.Providing the highest quality of care is our goal at
            Commonwise Home Care. If the one-on-one caregiver we provide to your loved one is not a good fit, we will
            replace them with another member of our care team. </p>
