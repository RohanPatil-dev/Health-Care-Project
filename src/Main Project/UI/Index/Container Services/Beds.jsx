            <p>When it comes to <span class="text-primary">hospital bed</span> servicing, it’s imperative that every piece of the bed is working perfectly
                to deliver quality patient care.</p>

            <p><span class="text-primary">hospital beds</span> are being used 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, so they need to be in top condition for
                both the patient’s and the carer’s peace of mind. So, what’s included in hospital bed servicing?</p>

            <p class="mt-5 text-danger">HOW TO SERVICE A HOSPITAL BED</p>

            <p>The first thing to note is that you should only use a trained service engineer to carry out any kind of
                hospital equipment maintenance or servicing. Whether it’s overhead hoists, recliner chairs, or indeed
                <span class="text-primary">hospital beds</span>, you should leave it to an engineer to sort it out.</p>

            <p>You might already have a hospital bed servicing contract in place with the company who supplied your
                equipment; if so, contact them to arrange a service if necessary.</p>


            <p class="text-danger mt-5">WHAT GETS CHECKED IN HOSPITAL BED SERVICING?</p>

            <p>Practically every function and piece of the bed will be checked in a service. This is to ensure that the
                <span class="text-primary">hospital bed.</span> is still performing as well as it should be, and to make sure that patients and staff are
                safe to use it.</p>
            <p>The service engineer will carry out some visual checks on the bed first. This will give them a good idea
                of how the bed is faring up overall and it will help them identify any potential problem areas that
                might need some repair work.</p>
            <p>They’ll check the bed ends, framework, base, and siderails for any obvious damage that might be a cause
                for concern. The engineer will also check the brakes and castors for any visible wear and tear that
                might affect the manoeuvrability of your bed.</p>
            <p>After that, the engineer should check all the electronic components on the hospital bed, including the
                tilt, lifting, head, and foot mechanisms that make the bed profile and move around according to the
                position. They will also check the motors and control box on the bed for any visible damage.</p>
            <p>If your bed is fitted with a sensor or an alarm to signify when a patient is off the bed, the engineer
                will check this to ensure that it is still in safe working order.</p>
            <p>The engineer will also take a look at the handset (both the patient and nurse control panels),
                transformer, and power lead for wear and tear. Finally, they’ll check the full operation of the bed —
                including all the various positions it can move to — to see if there are any issues or problems with the
                movement of the <span class="text-primary">hospital bed.</span></p>


            <p class="text-danger mt-5">WHY WOULD MY HOSPITAL BED FAIL ITS SERVICE?</p>
            <p>For each item that the engineer checks, they will mark down on a servicing sheet whether or not it has
                passed or failed the inspection. With some components, they may be able to repair or replace them on
                site during the service.</p>
            <p>Your <span class="text-primary">hospital bed</span> might fail its service for something like missing bolts, being unable to move to
                different positions or a bent frame. If there is a problem with the structure or the integrity of the
                frame on your hospital bed, it’s likely that the engineer would have to take it back to their workshop
                and complete the repairs there.</p>
            <p>Any good servicing provider should be able to arrange getting any damaged items taken away, fixed, and
                re-delivered to you.</p>


                <p class="text-danger mt-5">SUMMARY</p>
                <p>Pretty much every component of your hospital bed will be checked during a service to ensure that the equipment is safe to use and still performing well. This goes for practically any specialist healthcare equipment, and you should make sure it’s carried out regularly.</p>
